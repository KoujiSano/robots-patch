## Module Setup

:ModuleInstall{name="robots"}

## Non-Production Indexing

:UBadge{color="warning" variant="solid" label="Important"}

If you're using Preview / Staging / Testing environments you may need to configure these environments
to be disallowed from indexing by search engines.

Please read the [Disabling Indexing](/docs/robots/guides/disable-indexing) guide for more information.

## Previewing Your Robots.txt

After you've set up the module with the minimal config, you should be able to visit [`/robots.txt`](http://localhost:3000/robots.txt) to see the generated robots.txt.

You should also be able to inspect the HTML and see the `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` tag.

You can debug this further in Nuxt DevTools under the Robots tab.

## Next Steps

The module is now installed and configured!
