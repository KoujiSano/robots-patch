**Type:** `() => { indexable: boolean; hints: string[] }`

Get the robots config for the entire site.

This is useful for determining if the user has explicitly opted out of indexing the site or
they have a hosted non-production site.

## Usage

```ts
import { getSiteIndexable } from '#imports'

const { indexable, hints } = getSiteIndexable()
```
